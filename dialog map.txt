How do we connect the IPhone to the database in the easiest way possible?

Directly connect to the salesforce database to get the data

+ Faster, sends data directly, gets it back directly
- Have to use the mobile Salesforce SDK
- The phone and the admin console both need a way to connect
- Since the admin console is web based and the phone is mobile, they both may
need a different format for the data
- The admin console and the phone may ask for data at the same time

Use the web console to get the data

+ Dont need to have multiple ways of sending requests and recieving data
+ Only need to work with one version of salesforce SDK
- Have to got through the web console to get it, slower getting data
- The web console has to be active during the auction

Dont use Salesforce Database

- Cant use this. Working with Salesforce database is a requirement.
- Also if not used, we would need our own database
